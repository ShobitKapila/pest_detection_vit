# pest_detection_vit

1. This project is based on the detection of the pest in the agricultural fields using yolov8 model.
2. Here in this project we have trained a model based on the images dataset we have made and detect the pests 
3. Here we will be flying out a drone with an UDOO board attached and a camera module to detect the pest on the fields
4. When a pest is detected a signal is triggered in the UDOO board and it will send the signal to the laser attached to the drone 
5. Now, the drone will shoot out the laser on the pest from which we can control the pests on the agricultural fields
